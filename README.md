# Sleeping Barber problem

## Original problem description
[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem)

## Note
I provide difference implementation for different cases. 
With it, I can avoid the overloaded barber shop and it works with good performance. 

In the cmd package you can see an example usage for the *sleepy* package, but I recommend to check the *barber_test.go*
file for review
